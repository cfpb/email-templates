# CFPB Email Templates

All our interactions with the public (anyone outside the bureau,
including other federal or state agencies, institutions, and consummers)
should be easy to understand and use regardless of the communication channel
(website, printed pamphlets, reports, our consumer response hotline, and email).
Currently our email communications have not been given the same consideration
as some of our other channels of communication.     

This project aims to provide a technical framework, templates,
and a content strategy for external communication via email.     
  
Content guidelines will be hosted in the
[Design Manual](https://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/).
